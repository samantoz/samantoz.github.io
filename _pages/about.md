## <sub-heading> About Myself </sub-heading>

<text1> Relator, Developer, Adaptability, Responsibility, Harmony </text1>

I am highly engaged when I am learning and exploring new information/technology. I like to keep time for myself to think about multiple ways to find solution. It gives me immense confidence to try different ways to execute project (or write code) or do something.
I take time to get to know individuals on my team or social life and believe in trusting relationships that are high quality. Once I come to know someone I try to use their experience and strengths to work in a team. I am also quick at making aligned decisions on the suggestions made by right people on the right Technology/ Project.

I am a data engineer designing and implementing robust data pipelines for data-driven insights and solutions ensuring seamless data flow, transformation, and storage. I am also proficient in database management, ETL processes, and data modeling. Worked to optimize performance and reliability for diverse applications. Skilled in Python, SQL, and other big data technologies.

I have more than 25 years of IT services and project execution experience out of which around 15 years in the Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence area. I have predominantly worked in Banking, Insurance and Financial Services sectors. I have experince working in Scaled Agile Framework involving Agile Release Trains.
I have held leading roles in project management and delivery; as such have led multiple engagements ranging from application development to enterprise architect. I was involved in project planning, effort estimation, defining road-maps, value definition to operationalization involving architectures, implementation and service delivery. I have managed a global delivery team of more than 20 developers and software engineers.
