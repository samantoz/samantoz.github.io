This dataset contains around 200k news headlines from the year 2012 to 2018 obtained from HuffPost. The model trained on this dataset could be used to identify tags for untracked news articles or to identify the type of language used in different news articles.
- Can you categorize news articles based on their headlines and short descriptions?
- Do news articles from different categories have different writing styles?
- A classifier trained on this dataset could be used on a free text to identify the type of language being used.
