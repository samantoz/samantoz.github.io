This Exploratory Data Analysis that I did as part of my DSC530 project, I wanted to answer the following Statistical/Hypothetical Question:

The hypothesis under test is that price of item sold is less than the price of item not sold.

We are trying to predict the endogenous variable (dependant) variable sold flag using a logistic model. So that the retail firm can decide which products to keep in the inventory and which ones to discard.

The questions I wanted to get answered were:

- What currently determines the stock levels of an item?
- What is the strength_factor of a item?
- What can we say about the marketing_type and its impact on sales?
- What is the relevance to sales of an item being recently released?
- What is the relevance to sales of an item being a new release?
