    "title: \"Project 9: College Admission Analysis using Predictive Analytics\"\n",
    "excerpt: \"Higher education is now a massive industry, with 20 million American students enrolled in colleges. 77% of colleges and universities spend over 100,000 per annum on brand strategy work and among those about a third spend over $200,000 per year. This has become a growing trend in higher education. Although most colleges are non-profit but still they employ marketing professionals to reach out to and engage the millions of American college applicants per year. It was released on Sept of 2015. This dataset has been widely used in various news analysis and academic researched. As I was going over those articles, I became interested to see what type of information I can gather from it which could help High School age students looking for colleges and admission.\"\n",

    "It is a trend that almost all colleges employ predictive analytics and data analysis as an integral part of the admissions process over the past few years. Using tis college scorecard data I am trying to answer the following questions:\n",
    "* Based on the data on test scores, cost to attend, size of school and salary which school offers the best education\n",
    "* Are there certain schools or states where student debt and loan default rates are high compared to earnings?\n",
    "* Considering diversity, is there a good ratio of male/female, ethnic and racial mix?\n",
    "* What can we find about the income distribution patterns of the students getting admission?\n",
